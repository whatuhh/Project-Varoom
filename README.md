# Project-Varoom
In a nutshell, a super over-engineered go-kart built by a couple of 13-year-olds who enjoy pain aka engineering more down below after the warning and license thing.

 # In Depth
 Project-Varoom as stated before is an over-engineered go-kart
 Why am I documenting this?
 mostly because I've never documented anything before and I should probably at some point so this is that.
 also, it might help later on in college don't know but makeign a github repository documenting the engineering process of building something that is definitely useful in the real world
 and not just another stupid project like the one-person push drift kart that was built last year at 13 looks pretty decent on a college resume or even just a portfolio.
 also to clarify I am able to be on this website Thank you COPPA.

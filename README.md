 Why am i documenting this?
 mostly because ive never documented anything before and i should probably at some point so this is that.
 also it might help later on in collge i dont know but makeign a github repository documenting the engineering procese of building some that is deffinetly use full in the real world
 and not just another stupid priject like the one person push drift kart that was built last year at 13 looks pretty decent on a college resume or even just a portfolio.
 also to calrify i am able to be on this website i am 13 male dont come at me creeps.
